## 🚀 Features & Workflow

- 📥 **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Import CSV, handle missing values, outlier removal, and ensure data integrity.
- 📝 **Text Preprocessing:** Clean review titles with regex, remove stopwords, lemmatize, and handle negations for robust NLP.
- 🔢 **Feature Engineering:** Extract TF-IDF features from text for sentiment modeling.
- 🤖 **Model Training:** Train Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest classifiers for sentiment prediction.
- 📈 **Evaluation:** Compare models using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.
- 📊 **Visualization:** Explore data with histograms, boxplots, word clouds, and department/product-level insights.

## 🧰 Concepts & Libraries Used

- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **NLTK** for text preprocessing (stopwords, lemmatization, negation)
- **Scikit-learn** for TF-IDF, model training, and evaluation
- **WordCloud** for visualizing frequent terms
- **SciPy** for winsorizing outliers

## 🖥️ How to Run

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk wordcloud scipy
    ```

### Run the Analysis

1. Place `Womens Clothing Reviews.csv` in your project directory.
2. Open and run `project.ipynb` (main analysis notebook) in Jupyter.

## 📊 Key Analysis Steps

- **Data Integrity:** Check for missing values, drop or impute as needed.
- **Outlier Handling:** Use IQR and winsorization for `Age` and validate `Rating` range.
- **Text Cleaning:** Remove punctuation, lowercase, handle stopwords and negations, lemmatize.
- **Sentiment Labeling:** Ratings >3 as positive, ≤3 as negative.
- **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF on cleaned review titles.
- **Modeling:** Train/test split, fit classifiers, evaluate with accuracy and confusion matrices.
- **Visualization:** Sentiment distribution, rating histograms, department/product analysis, word clouds.
